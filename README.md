# **Toon Shader Showcase - Wastelands**
![Banner](https://github.com/Parven05/Project-Wastelands/assets/101796812/dc0727c2-d399-41e6-a50e-3c6397b10c3a)

## **Introduction:**
In this project, add some cartoon-style shading features. These will make objects in the game look like they're from a cartoon. We'll use a toon shader we found on symm in itch.io and add an edge detection filter as a finishing touch. This helps us see where the edges of objects are more clearly. Remember, this project is open source, so anyone can use it to make their own games or projects. Just make sure to give credit to the original creators of the shaders. This way, everyone can learn and create cool stuff !

## **Project Details:**
