# **BiRP Unity Toon Shader Showcase - Wastelands**
![Banner](https://github.com/Parven05/Project-Wastelands/assets/101796812/dc0727c2-d399-41e6-a50e-3c6397b10c3a)

## **Introduction:**
In this project, we'll add some cartoon-like effects to our game. We'll use a toon shader feature, which gives objects a cartoonish appearance. We'll get this shader from a source called "Symm" on itch.io. Additionally, we'll apply an edge detection filter as part of the post-processing stack to enhance the cartoon effect. This project is open-source, meaning anyone can use it to make their own games or projects. However, it's important to credit the original authors of the shaders because they created them. We're using their work for learning and experimenting purposes, and this project will provide game-ready shader assets for others to use.

## **Project Details:**
3D BiRP - Unity Version 2022.3.20f1 LTS
